A chat manager called "Edem Edem" for Telegram, written in Aiogram 3 and additional libraries. Focused on working in chats.

Basically uses libraries:
Asyncio - for synchronization;
Aiogram3 - for the bot itself;
Sqlite3 - for database operation;
Datetime - for working with date and time.

The full list of changes is listed in the Changelog file. On GitHub, the latest published version is version 0.8.1, which will be updated very rarely, if at all.
The code can only be used as a basis for your chat managers, you can not assign it to yourself
